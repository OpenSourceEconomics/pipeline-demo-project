Demo Projects for pipeline
==========================

This repository contains some demo projects which show the capabilities of **pipeline**
and present a starting point for users who want to implement similar workflows.


List of workflows
-----------------

- `simple-project <simple-project>`_ shows the workflow from generating data over
  fitting a model and presenting the results in a regression table. This workflow is
  standard for every empirical science project.

- `priority-scheduling-bootstrap-monte-carlo
  <priority-scheduling-bootstrap-monte-carlo>`_ shows how to assign priorities to tasks
  and how it influences the execution of a workflow.
